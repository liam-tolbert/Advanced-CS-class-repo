1) Every node has a color either red or black.

2) Root of tree is always black.

3) There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).

4) Every path from root to a NULL node has same number of black nodes

black height: Number of noes on some path from any node to a leaf. Leaf nodes are also counted as black nodes
Every RBT with n nodes has height less than or equal to 2logBASE2(n+1)

A chain of 3 nodes is nodes is not possible in Red-Black Trees.
